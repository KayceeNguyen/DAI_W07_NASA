This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Description

    Welcome to a fascinating website that showcases the incredible technologies NASA is working on every day. Using the TechPort and PIC API from NASA, this website provides a unique opportunity for the public to discover the incredible technologies NASA is developing in areas such as propulsion, nanotechnology, robotics, and human health.

    In addition to this, the website offers full disc imagery of the Earth and captures unique perspectives of certain astronomical events using the EPIC API. The EPIC API provides information on the daily imagery collected by DSCOVR's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument, which is positioned at the Earth-Sun Lagrange point. This allows the website to provide stunning images of the Earth from a unique vantage point and capture unique perspectives of astronomical events such as lunar transits.

    Explore the amazing technologies NASA is working on every day and get a glimpse of the beauty and wonder of the universe through this exciting website.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## Instalation

npm i axios


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
